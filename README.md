# Circle
Simple game involving a jumping circle across a line

## Notes
* The background colour changes randomly every 10 points, which can sometimes make it hard to see the circle and the lines
* The highscore is stored in the highscore.txt file
* The circle sometimes glitches slightly into the line during a collision
